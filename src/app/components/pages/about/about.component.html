          Ever since I have been a little kid I have had the motivation to create. Starting with a love for puzzles building forts everywhere, I had a passion for creating and imagining something that wasn't even there. As I aged I was always playing sports, training for sports, or watching sports. This caused me to always spend my time I got away to play and mod video games. After going out to California for baseball, I had to leave after a semester due to re-tearing my UCL. (where I previously received Tommy John surgery) This was when I was able to chase my passion in technology. Currently I have received my Micro-Degree from the DaVinci Institute, as well as multiple certificates. (Ruby on Rails and C# Game Development). Once I completed everything I felt needed at DaVinci, I took to my own time learning other languages and skills. I am now a full stack developer and am now just improving upon my skills. A few things I love to do other then computers are lifting (I am a fitness nut), robotics, and fishing. At the age of 20 I know I have my life ahead of me, but I also know it will be full of technology. I have an obsession with self improvement and furthering myself...
